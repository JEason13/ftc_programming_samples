# ftc_programming_samples
These are some basic (and advanced) programming samples for you to practice with.

You can download to android studio or copy and paste the file contents into a new code with sololearn (https://www.sololearn.com/) and from there you can edit the code and try to make it look like the example. 

Included within this repository will be a teleoperated (TeleOp) and autonomous (Auton) example code. And maybe some VuForia as well. 

Teleop is when there is a person driving the robot using a game-pad (Xbox-360 or Logitech). Auton is when the robot moves based off of pre-programmed directions and sensor inputs. 

VuForia is a kind of software where it allows a program with camera acsess to scan images with VuMarks on them and can tell the program what to do based off of what you say to do when the image is detected.
